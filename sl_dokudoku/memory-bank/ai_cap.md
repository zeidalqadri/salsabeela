here's a detailed, efficient plan to implement the AI-driven features (NLQ, Summarization, Semantic Search) using the recommended stack (LangChain/FastAPI Python backend, PostgreSQL/pgvector, Sentence Transformers, OpenAI/Ollama, Next.js frontend).
This plan prioritizes getting a functional end-to-end flow quickly and iterating.
Phase 1: Foundations & Setup (Parallel Backend/DB)
Goal: Prepare the environment and database.
Tasks:
DB Admin: Install the pgvector extension on your PostgreSQL database. Verify installation.
Backend Dev: Set up a new Python project directory (e.g., rag_backend). Initialize a virtual environment.
Backend Dev: Install core Python dependencies: fastapi, uvicorn, langchain, langchain-openai, langchain-community, sentence-transformers, psycopg2-binary (or asyncpg), python-dotenv.
Backend Dev: Create basic FastAPI app structure (main.py, perhaps separate routers later).
Backend Dev: Configure environment variables (.env file): DATABASE_URL, OPENAI_API_KEY. Load these in the FastAPI app.
Backend Dev: Establish a basic database connection test within the FastAPI app to ensure it can connect to PostgreSQL.
Phase 2: Document Processing Pipeline (Backend - Core RAG Logic)
Goal: Ingest documents, extract text, create embeddings, store in pgvector.
Tasks:
Backend Dev: Design the database schema modification for pgvector. Add a table (e.g., document_chunks) to store chunk_text, embedding (vector type), document_id (foreign key to your existing Document table), chunk_index. Use Prisma Migrate (if managing schema via Prisma) or raw SQL to apply this. Alternatively, add the vector column directly to your main document table if you don't expect many chunks per document, but a separate table is usually better.
Backend Dev: Implement Document Loading:
Choose initial format(s) (e.g., PDF, TXT). Use LangChain's PyMuPDFLoader, TextLoader.
Create a Python function process_document(file_path: str, document_id: str) that takes a file path and the corresponding ID from your main Document table.
Backend Dev: Implement Text Splitting (Chunking):
Inside process_document, after loading, use LangChain's RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter (a good starting point) to break the document text into chunks. Configure chunk size and overlap.
Backend Dev: Implement Embedding Generation:
Initialize the chosen Sentence Transformer model (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2) via LangChain's HuggingFaceEmbeddings.
Generate embeddings for each text chunk.
Backend Dev: Implement Vector Storage:
Use LangChain's PGVector vector store interface. Configure it with your connection string, embedding function, and the name of the table/collection created in step 1.
Use the add_texts (or similar) method of the vector store to save the chunks and their embeddings, associating them with the document_id.
Backend Dev: Create an initial Trigger Mechanism:
Build a simple FastAPI endpoint (e.g., POST /api/rag/process/{document_id}) that takes a document_id, finds the corresponding file path (assuming your main app stores this), and calls process_document. This can be refined later with background tasks.
Alternatively, modify your existing Next.js document upload endpoint to call this new FastAPI processing endpoint after the file is successfully saved.
Testing: Manually upload a test document via your existing mechanism, then trigger the processing endpoint. Verify data appears in your document_chunks table (or equivalent) using a DB tool.
Phase 3: Basic Querying API (Backend - RAG Logic)
Goal: Accept a query, find relevant chunks, and get an answer from the LLM.
Tasks:
Backend Dev: Create a FastAPI endpoint: POST /api/rag/query. It should accept a JSON body like { "query": "user question" }.
Backend Dev: Initialize the Embedding function and PGVector vector store within the endpoint's scope (or globally if appropriate).
Backend Dev: Implement Similarity Search: Use the vector store's similarity_search method, passing the user's query and k (number of chunks to retrieve, e.g., 4). This will embed the query and find the most similar chunks in pgvector.
Backend Dev: Initialize the OpenAI LLM integration via LangChain (ChatOpenAI).
Backend Dev: Implement Prompt Engineering (Simple): Create a basic prompt template (using LangChain's PromptTemplate) that includes placeholders for the retrieved context (the text of the relevant chunks) and the user's question. Example: "Context: {context}\n\nQuestion: {question}\n\nAnswer:"
Backend Dev: Create a LangChain Chain: Use a simple chain like load_qa_chain or construct a basic RunnableSequence (LCEL) to connect the prompt, LLM, and output parsing.
Backend Dev: Execute the Chain: Pass the retrieved context chunks and the user query to the chain.
Backend Dev: Return the Result: Send the LLM's answer back as the API response.
Testing: Use tools like curl or Postman to send test queries to this endpoint and verify responses.
Phase 4: Frontend Integration (Querying)
Goal: Provide a UI for users to ask questions and see answers.
Tasks:
Frontend Dev: Create a UI component in Next.js for querying (e.g., a chat input box or a simple query field).
Frontend Dev: Implement state management for the input query, the loading status, and the received answer/error.
Frontend Dev: On query submission, call the POST /api/rag/query FastAPI endpoint from the Next.js component (using fetch or a library like axios).
Frontend Dev: Display the answer received from the backend. Handle loading indicators and display error messages appropriately.
(Parallel possible): Backend work on Phase 5 can start while the frontend for querying is being built.
Phase 5: Summarization API & Integration (Backend + Frontend)
Goal: Generate and display summaries for specific documents.
Tasks:
Backend Dev: Create a FastAPI endpoint: POST /api/rag/summarize/{document_id}.
Backend Dev: Retrieve Text: Fetch all processed chunks for the given document_id from your document_chunks table (or fetch the full text if stored separately and chunk here).
Backend Dev: Initialize LLM (as in Phase 3).
Backend Dev: Implement Summarization Chain: Use LangChain's load_summarize_chain. Choose a strategy:
stuff: Simple, puts all text in one prompt (fails if too long).
map_reduce: Summarizes chunks individually, then summarizes the summaries (good for long docs). Start with this.
Backend Dev: Execute the Chain: Pass the document chunks to the summarization chain.
Backend Dev: Return the summary.
Frontend Dev: Add a "Summarize" button/action in your Next.js document list or detail view.
Frontend Dev: On button click, call the POST /api/rag/summarize/{document_id} endpoint.
Frontend Dev: Display the returned summary (e.g., in a modal). Handle loading/error states.
Phase 6: Refinement, Optimization & Iteration
Goal: Improve performance, robustness, and potentially swap components.
Tasks:
Error Handling: Add robust error handling and logging throughout the Python backend pipeline and APIs.
Async Processing: Convert the document processing pipeline (Phase 2, Task 6) to use a background task queue (like Celery with Redis/RabbitMQ, or Python's asyncio with BackgroundTask in FastAPI for simpler cases) so uploads don't block.
Prompt Engineering: Iterate on prompts (Phase 3, Task 5; Phase 5, Task 4) for better quality answers and summaries.
Retrieval Strategy: Experiment with k in similarity search, or try more advanced retrieval methods in LangChain (e.g., MMR - Maximal Marginal Relevance).
Testing: Add unit tests for Python functions and integration tests for API endpoints.
Ollama Integration (Optional): If needed, set up Ollama, download an open-source LLM, and switch the LangChain LLM integration from ChatOpenAI to ChatOllama. This requires deploying Ollama alongside your FastAPI service.
Deployment: Containerize the FastAPI application (Dockerfile), set up deployment for both Next.js and FastAPI (e.g., using Docker Compose, Kubernetes, or managed services).
Efficiency Notes:
Parallel Work: Frontend UI (Phase 4 & 5) can largely happen in parallel with backend API development (Phase 3 & 5) once the API contracts (endpoints, request/response structure) are defined.
Start Simple: Get the core end-to-end flow working (upload -> process -> store -> query -> display) before optimizing heavily or adding complex features like advanced retrieval or background queues.
Iterate: Don't aim for perfection in Phase 2/3. Get it working, then refine chunking, prompts, and retrieval based on results.
Focus: Stick to the core path for PDF/TXT initially. Add other loaders (DOCX, etc.) and OCR later as needed.
This plan provides a structured approach to efficiently build the desired AI capabilities on top of your existing application structure. Remember to adapt based on specific challenges and discoveries during development.
