## What's Left to Build
- **Technology Assessment Process:** Need to establish a process for evaluating and prioritizing new technologies.
- **Financial Intelligence Systems:** Systems for tracking funding opportunities and cost benchmarking still in development.

## Current Status
- **Phase 1: Intelligence Gathering:** Market monitoring systems and competitor profiling framework in place.
- **Phase 2: Analysis & Insights:** Conducting SWOT analysis and developing market segmentation.

## Known Issues
- **Data Integration:** Challenges in integrating data from various sources into a centralized repository.
- **Resource Allocation:** Limited resources for comprehensive technology assessments.
